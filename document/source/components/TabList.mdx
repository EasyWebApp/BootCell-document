## Tabs mode

`mode="tabs"` is built based on [Nav](components/nav).

Dynamic tabbed interfaces, as described in the
[<abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices][1],
require `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`, and additional `aria-` attributes in order to convey their structure,
functionality and current state to users of assistive technologies (such as screen readers).

Note that dynamic tabbed interfaces should not contain dropdown menus,
as this causes both usability and accessibility issues.
From a usability perspective, the fact that the currently displayed tab’s trigger element is not immediately visible
(as it’s inside the closed dropdown menu) can cause confusion.
From an accessibility point of view, there is currently no sensible way to map this sort of construct to a standard WAI ARIA pattern,
meaning that it cannot be easily made understandable to users of assistive technologies.

<Example>
    <TabList
        list={[
            {
                title: 'WebCell',
                content: 'Web Components engine based on JSX & TypeScript'
            },
            {
                title: 'Cell Router',
                content:
                    'Decorator based Router component framework, powered by WebCell'
            },
            {
                title: 'BootCell',
                content:
                    'Web Components UI library based on WebCell v2, BootStrap v4 & FontAwesome v5'
            },
            {
                title: 'KoAJAX',
                content: 'HTTP Client based on Koa-like middlewares'
            }
        ]}
    />
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { TabList } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/TabList';

render(
    <TabList
        list={[
            {
                title: 'WebCell',
                content: 'Web Components engine based on JSX & TypeScript'
            },
            {
                title: 'Cell Router',
                content:
                    'Decorator based Router component framework, powered by WebCell'
            },
            {
                title: 'BootCell',
                content:
                    'Web Components UI library based on WebCell v2, BootStrap v4 & FontAwesome v5'
            },
            {
                title: 'KoAJAX',
                content: 'HTTP Client based on Koa-like middlewares'
            }
        ]}
    />
);
```

## Pills mode

`mode="pills"` is built based on [Nav](components/nav).

<Example>
    <TabList
        mode="pills"
        list={[
            {
                title: 'WebCell',
                content: 'Web Components engine based on JSX & TypeScript'
            },
            {
                title: 'Cell Router',
                content:
                    'Decorator based Router component framework, powered by WebCell'
            },
            {
                title: 'BootCell',
                content:
                    'Web Components UI library based on WebCell v2, BootStrap v4 & FontAwesome v5'
            },
            {
                title: 'KoAJAX',
                content: 'HTTP Client based on Koa-like middlewares'
            }
        ]}
    />
