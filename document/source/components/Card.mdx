## About

A **card** is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers,
a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.
If you’re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails.
Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.

## Example

Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible,
but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization.

Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width.
Cards have no fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element.
This is easily customized with our various [sizing options](#sizing).

<Example>
    <Card
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        title="Card title"
        text="Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content."
    >
        <Button>Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card>
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';
import { Button } from 'boot-cell/source/Form/Button';

render(
    <Card
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        title="Card title"
        text="Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content."
    >
        <Button>Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card>
);
```

## Content types

Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more.
Below are examples of what’s supported.

### Body

The building block of a card is the `.card-body`. Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.

<Example>
    <Card text="This is some text within a card body." />
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';

render(
    <Card text="This is some text within a card body." />
);
```

### Titles, text, and links

Card titles are used by adding `.card-title` to a `<h* />` tag. In the same way,
links are added and placed next to each other by adding `.card-link` to an `<a />` tag.

<Example>
    <Card
        title="Card title"
        subtitle="Card subtitle"
        text="Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content."
    >
        <a className="card-link" href="javascript: void;">
            Card link
        </a>
        <a className="card-link" href="javascript: void;">
            Another link
        </a>
    </Card>
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';

render(
    <Card
        title="Card title"
        subtitle="Card subtitle"
        text="Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content."
    >
        <a className="card-link" href="javascript: void;">
            Card link
        </a>
        <a className="card-link" href="javascript: void;">
            Another link
        </a>
    </Card>
);
```

### Images

`image` property places an image to the top of the card. With `text` property, text can be added to the card.

<Example>
    <Card
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        text="Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content."
    />
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';

render(
    <Card
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        text="Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content."
    />
);
```

### Header and footer

Add an optional header and/or footer within a card.

<Example>
    <Card
        header="Featured"
        title="Special title treatment"
        text="With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content."
    >
        <Button>Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card>
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';
import { Button } from 'boot-cell/source/Form/Button';

render(
    <Card
        header="Featured"
        title="Special title treatment"
        text="With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content."
    >
        <Button>Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card>
);
```

<Example>
    <Card header="Quote">
        <blockquote className="blockquote mb-0">
            <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
                posuere erat a ante.
            </p>
            <footer className="blockquote-footer">
                Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
            </footer>
        </blockquote>
    </Card>
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';

render(
    <Card header="Quote">
        <blockquote className="blockquote mb-0">
            <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
                posuere erat a ante.
            </p>
            <footer className="blockquote-footer">
                Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
            </footer>
        </blockquote>
    </Card>
);
```

<Example>
    <Card
        className="text-center"
        header="Featured"
        title="Special title treatment"
        text="With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content."
        footer="2 days ago"
    >
        <Button>Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card>
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';
import { Button } from 'boot-cell/source/Form/Button';

render(
    <Card
        className="text-center"
        header="Featured"
        title="Special title treatment"
        text="With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content."
        footer="2 days ago"
    >
        <Button>Go somewhere</Button>
    </Card>
);
```

## Images

### Image overlays

Turn an image into a card background and overlay your card’s text.
Depending on the image, you may or may not need additional styles or utilities.

<Example>
    <Card
        className="bg-dark text-white"
        title="Card title"
        text="This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer."
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        overlay
    >
        <time>Last updated 3 mins ago</time>
    </Card>
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';

render(
    <Card
        className="bg-dark text-white"
        title="Card title"
        text="This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer."
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        overlay
    >
        <time>Last updated 3 mins ago</time>
    </Card>
);
```

> Note that content should not be larger than the height of the image.
> If content is larger than the image the content will be displayed outside the image.

## Horizontal

Using a combination of grid and utility classes, cards can be made horizontal in a mobile-friendly and responsive way.
Further adjustments may be needed depending on your card content.

<Example>
    <Card
        title="Card title"
        text="This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer."
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        direction="horizontal"
    >
        <small className="text-muted">Last updated 3 mins ago</small>
    </Card>
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Card } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Card';

render(
    <Card
        title="Card title"
        text="This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer."
        image="https://tech-query.me/medias/featureimages/6.jpg"
        direction="horizontal"
    >
        <small className="text-muted">Last updated 3 mins ago</small>
    </Card>
);
```
