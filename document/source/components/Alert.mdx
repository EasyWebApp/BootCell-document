> ##### Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
>
> Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication,
> which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies –
> such as screen readers.
> Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself
> (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means,
> such as additional text hidden with the `.sr-only` class.

## Additional content

Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.

<Example>
    <Alert type="success" title="Well done!">
        <p>
            Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This
            example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how
            spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p className="mb-0">
            Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things
            nice and tidy.
        </p>
    </Alert>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Alert } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Alert';

render(
    <Alert type="success" title="Well done!">
        <p>
            Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This
            example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how
            spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p className="mb-0">
            Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things
            nice and tidy.
        </p>
    </Alert>
);
```

## Dismissing

You can see this in action with a live demo:

<Example>
    <Alert type="warning" closable>
        <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those
        fields below.
    </Alert>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { Alert } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Alert';

render(
    <Alert type="warning" closable>
        <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those
        fields below.
    </Alert>
);
```
