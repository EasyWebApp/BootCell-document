Toasts are lightweight notifications designed to mimic the push notifications that have been popularized by mobile and desktop operating systems.
They’re built with flexbox, so they’re easy to align and position.

## Examples

### Basic

To encourage extensible and predictable toasts, we recommend a header and body.
Toast headers use `display: flex`, allowing easy alignment of content thanks to our margin and flexbox utilities.

Toasts are as flexible as you need and have very little required markup.
At a minimum, we require a single element to contain your “toasted” content and strongly encourage a dismiss button.

<Example className="bg-light">
    <ToastBox
        icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
        title="Bootstrap"
        time="11 mins ago"
    >
        Hello, world! This is a toast message.
    </ToastBox>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { ToastBox } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Toast';

render(
    <ToastBox
        icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
        title="Bootstrap"
        time="11 mins ago"
    >
        Hello, world! This is a toast message.
    </ToastBox>
);
```

### Translucent

Toasts are slightly translucent, too, so they blend over whatever they might appear over.
For browsers that support the `backdrop-filter` CSS property, we’ll also attempt to blur the elements under a toast.

<Example className="bg-dark">
    <ToastBox
        icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
        title="Bootstrap"
        time="11 mins ago"
    >
        Hello, world! This is a toast message.
    </ToastBox>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { ToastBox } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Toast';

render(
    <ToastBox
        icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
        title="Bootstrap"
        time="11 mins ago"
    >
        Hello, world! This is a toast message.
    </ToastBox>
);
```

### Stacking

When you have multiple toasts, we default to vertically stacking them in a readable manner.

<Example className="bg-light">
    <ToastBox
        icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
        title="Bootstrap"
        time="just now"
    >
        See? Just like this.
    </ToastBox>
    <ToastBox
        icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
        title="Bootstrap"
        time="2 seconds ago"
    >
        Heads up, toasts will stack automatically
    </ToastBox>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell, Fragment } from 'web-cell';
import { ToastBox } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Toast';

render(
    <Fragment>
        <ToastBox
            icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
            title="Bootstrap"
            time="just now"
        >
            See? Just like this.
        </ToastBox>
        <ToastBox
            icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
            title="Bootstrap"
            time="2 seconds ago"
        >
            Heads up, toasts will stack automatically
        </ToastBox>
    </Fragment>
);
```

## Placement

Place toasts with custom CSS as you need them. The top right is often used for notifications, as is the top middle.
If you’re only ever going to show one toast at a time, put the positioning styles right on the `<Toast />`.

<Example className="bg-dark">
    <div
        className="position-relative vh-50"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
    >
        <ToastBox
            className="position-absolute right-0"
            icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
            title="Bootstrap"
            time="11 mins ago"
        >
            Hello, world! This is a toast message.
        </ToastBox>
    </div>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { ToastBox } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Toast';

render(
    <div
        className="position-relative vh-50"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
    >
        <ToastBox
            className="position-absolute right-0"
            icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
            title="Bootstrap"
            time="11 mins ago"
        >
            Hello, world! This is a toast message.
        </ToastBox>
    </div>
);
```

For systems that generate more notifications, consider using a wrapping element so they can easily stack.

<Example className="bg-dark">
    <div
        className="position-relative vh-50"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
    >
        <div className="position-absolute right-0">
            <ToastBox
                icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
                title="Bootstrap"
                time="just now"
            >
                See? Just like this.
            </ToastBox>
            <ToastBox
                className="position-absolute right-0"
                icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
                title="Bootstrap"
                time="2 seconds ago"
            >
                Heads up, toasts will stack automatically
            </ToastBox>
        </div>
    </div>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { ToastBox } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Toast';

render(
    <div
        className="position-relative vh-50"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
    >
        <div className="position-absolute right-0">
            <ToastBox
                className="position-absolute right-0"
                icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
                title="Bootstrap"
                time="just now"
            >
                See? Just like this.
            </ToastBox>
            <ToastBox
                className="position-absolute right-0"
                icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
                title="Bootstrap"
                time="2 seconds ago"
            >
                Heads up, toasts will stack automatically
            </ToastBox>
        </div>
    </div>
);
```

You can also get fancy with flexbox utilities to align toasts horizontally and/or vertically.

<Example className="bg-dark">
    <div
        className="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center vh-50"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
    >
        <ToastBox
            icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
            title="Bootstrap"
            time="11 mins ago"
        >
            Hello, world! This is a toast message.
        </ToastBox>
    </div>
</Example>

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { ToastBox } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Toast';

render(
    <div
        className="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center vh-50"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
    >
        <ToastBox
            icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
            title="Bootstrap"
            time="11 mins ago"
        >
            Hello, world! This is a toast message.
        </ToastBox>
    </div>
);
```

## Accessibility

Toasts are intended to be small interruptions to your visitors or users,
so to help those with screen readers and similar assistive technologies,
you should wrap your toasts in an [aria-live region][1].
Changes to live regions (such as injecting/updating a toast component)
are automatically announced by screen readers without needing to move the user’s focus or otherwise interrupt the user.
Additionally, include `aria-atomic="true"` to ensure that the entire toast is always announced as a single (atomic) unit,
rather than announcing what was changed (which could lead to problems if you only update part of the toast’s content,
or if displaying the same toast content at a later point in time). If the information needed is important for the process,
e.g. for a list of errors in a form, then use the [alert component][2] instead of toast.

Note that the live region needs to be present in the markup before the toast is generated or updated.
If you dynamically generate both at the same time and inject them into the page,
they will generally not be announced by assistive technologies.

You also need to adapt the `role` and `aria-live` level depending on the content.
If it’s an important message like an error, use `role="alert" aria-live="assertive"`,
otherwise use `role="status" aria-live="polite"` attributes.

As the content you’re displaying changes, be sure to update the `delay` timeout to ensure people have enough time to read the toast.

```TSX
import { render, createCell } from 'web-cell';
import { ToastBox } from 'boot-cell/source/Prompt/Toast';

render(
    <ToastBox
        icon="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/assets/img/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"
        title="Bootstrap"
        time="just now"
        delay={10000}
    >
        I'll disappear in 10 seconds.
    </ToastBox>
);
```
