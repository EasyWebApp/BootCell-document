## Accordion example

Using the [card](components/card) component, you can extend the default collapse behavior to create an accordion.

<Example>
    <AccordionList
        list={[
            {
                title: 'WebCell',
                content: 'Web Components engine based on JSX & TypeScript',
                active: true
            },
            {
                title: 'Cell Router',
                content:
                    'Decorator based Router component framework, powered by WebCell'
            },
            {
                title: 'BootCell',
                content:
                    'Web Components UI library based on WebCell v2, BootStrap v4 & FontAwesome v5'
            }
        ]}
    />
</Example>

```JavaScript
import { render } from 'web-cell';
import { AccordionList } from 'boot-cell/source/Content/Accordion';

render(
    <AccordionList
        list={[
            {
                title: 'WebCell',
                content: 'Web Components engine based on JSX & TypeScript',
                active: true
            },
            {
                title: 'Cell Router',
                content:
                    'Decorator based Router component framework, powered by WebCell'
            },
            {
                title: 'BootCell',
                content:
                    'Web Components UI library based on WebCell v2, BootStrap v4 & FontAwesome v5'
            }
        ]}
    />
);
